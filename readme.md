# Pokedex Tracker

My final project for CSE 204 is a pokedex tracker built using TypeScript, JQuery, and Boootstrap. This pokedex tracker is meant as a helper tool for people completing a Gen IV Pokemon National Dex by keeping track of completion via a checklist and also helping show how to obtain various pokemon. The data is pulled from the PokeApi, and unfortunately there are some holes in the API's data. Particularly when it comes to legendary pokemon static encounters.

I had to work with what I got, but now I want to go help fill in data for PokeAPI! As a result of this project, I got to submit a GitHub Issue for the first time!
